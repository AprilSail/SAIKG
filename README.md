SAIKG: Simulated Agent Interaction Knowledge Graph

We conduct a simulation of intelligent agent combat on our platform and meticulously document the process. Due to data security and other constraints, these records cannot be publicly disclosed. In constructing SAIKG, we employ randomized encoding for equipment and organization entities in lieu of their original identifiers, while preserving the integrity of their respective types.

The SAIKG provided is structured as quadruples, derived from the interaction records. It encompasses agent interactions recorded from April 30, 2019 to November 3, 2020, comprising 5,758 entities, 38 relationships, and 363 timestamps. We utilize the Label-Based TKG Construction Process for text analysis and extraction to form the SAIKG and introduce the Coherence Mode method for temporal knowledge graph inference.

Specific details can be found in the manuscript: "Coherence Mode: Characterizing Local Graph Structural Information for Temporal Knowledge Graph".
